# PlatformerGame

This is a 3D platformer game developed in unity with C# scripting. 

To play the game, go to https://hkommaraju.github.io/PlatformerGame/ or https://play.unity.com/mg/other/neonpath . 

The game has a single player with running and jumping movements, coins to collect and cutters which take away coins on the obstacle path. The goal is to cross the obstacle path and collect the final gem. In case the player falls through the gap in the path, every 5 coins give an additional dynamic life and can be used to restore the player to the last stable point before they fell. The player has restarts available as long as they have an additional life. 

The game is over if the player falls through a gap and doesn't have an additional life. The game is completed if the player reaches the end and collects the final gem.

The game has an ui designed to navigate between play and quit options and to display the current number of coins, additional lives and banners for welcome page, game over and game completed.
